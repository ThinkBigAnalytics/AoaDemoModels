# Overview
Simple xgboost model python model based on the medical records for Pima Indians and whether or not each patient will have an onset of diabetes within ve years.

A sample notebook is located [here](notebooks/Explore%20Diabetes.ipynb).

# Datasets
The dataset required to train or evaluate this model is the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset available [here](http://nrvis.com/data/mldata/pima-indians-diabetes.csv). The teradataml code to import it is

```python
import pandas as pd
from teradataml.dataframe.copy_to import copy_to_sql
from teradataml.dataframe.dataframe import DataFrame

df = pd.read_csv("http://nrvis.com/data/mldata/pima-indians-diabetes.csv", header=None)
df.columns = ["NumTimesPrg", "PlGlcConc", "BloodP", "SkinThick", "TwoHourSerIns", "BMI", "DiPedFunc", "Age", "HasDiabetes"]

copy_to_sql(df = df, table_name = "PIMA", index=True, index_label="PatientId", if_exists="replace")

df = DataFrame("PIMA").sample(frac=[0.8, 0.2])

copy_to_sql(df = df[df.sampleid==1], table_name = "PIMA_TRAIN", index=False, if_exists="replace")
copy_to_sql(df = df[df.sampleid==2], table_name = "PIMA_TEST", index=False, if_exists="replace")
```


The dataset metadata required is

Training

    {
        "host": "<vantage host>",
        "table": "<training dataset>"
    }

Evaluation/Scoring

   {
        "host": "<vantage host>",
        "table": "<test dataset>",
        "predictions": "<predictions output table>"
    }
    
For Batch scoring, we also include the [dataset_template.json](./scheduler/dataset_template.json) which is required by the Airflow (or other) scheduler. This will not be necessary anymore after 2.7+ of the AOA as the user will select the dataset template when deploying.

# Training
The [training.py](model_modules/training.py) produces the following artifacts

- model.joblib     (sklearn pipeline with scalers and xgboost model)
- model.pmml       (pmml version of the xgboost model and sklearn pipeline)

# Evaluation
Evaluation is defined in the `evaluate` method in [scoring.py](model_modules/scoring.py) and it returns the following metrics

- Accuracy
- Recall
- Precision
- f1-score

We produce a number of plots for each evaluation also

- roc curve
- confusion matrix

We also use shap to save some global explainability plots which help understand the importance and contribution of each feature

- shap feature importance


# Scoring 
This demo mode supports two types of scoring

 - Batch
 - RESTful
 - In-Vantage (IVSM)

In-Vantage scoring is supported via the PMML model we produce during scoring.

Batch Scoring is supported via the `score` method in [scoring.py](model_modules/scoring.py). As Evaluation is batch score + compare, the scoring logic is already validated with the evaluation step. As batch scoring is run by a scheduler, the scheduler must know how to tell it what dataset (`data_conf`) it should execute on. It does this by using the `scheduler/dataset_template.json` which is templated by the scheduler (airflow in the demo) with things such as dates which are necessary. This will not be necessary anymore after 2.7+ of the AOA as the user will select the dataset template when deploying. 

Again, as this is a demo model where we a reading the dataset from the web, we simply print the scoring results to stdout. A future update of this can use s3.

RESTful scoring is supported via the `ModelScorer` class which implements a predict method which is called by the RESTful Serving Engine. An example request is  

    curl -X POST http://<service-name>/predict \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
            "data": {
                "ndarray": [
                        6,
                        148,
                        72,
                        35,
                        0,
                        33.6,
                        0.627,
                        50
                ]
            }
        }'
